# Stakeholder Interviews

During the planning stage of the project, I thought it would be wise to get some insight from real people who would be a potential part of the site's audience, rather than projecting my own ideas of what users may require from the site. The results of these are detailed below (all answers shown as written).

## Interviewee 1: Jonathan Rashleigh, client

Jonathan Rashleigh is the owner of the club's current site and team captain for the club. I posed a few questions to him to get some insight into his visions, ideas, and goals for the site, those being:   

- As the site owner, what value do you hope to gain from the site? What problems or opportunities do you want it to address?

- What features and content do you think the site should include to include to address those?

- Of those, which do you feel are the most important?

- What do you expect the primary demographic of site users to be?

> I want the site to ensure that Kendal Chess Club is visible to as many people in the locality as possible and that the site shows up high on all internet searches remotely related to chess in South Cumbria.   
>
> The main focus is therefore on trying to attract new members - both by the site being accessible and the site content selling the club as a friendly and fun place to play chess.   
>
> The content should therefore be factual but also light hearted reinforcing the fun of playing and being a club member. 
>
> Most importantly the site needs to be constantly kept fresh with up to date news, comments etc.  This is difficult with so little club activity to report on at present but must remain the aim.   
>
> The site also needs to be marketed harder to existing club members with encouragement for them to contribute content.  There needs to be synergy with the Cumbria Chess Association website maintained by Dave Shaw such that duplication of content is minimised but with the Kendal site being more personal, detailed and lighthearted  take on the matches played etc and the source of information on internal tournaments etc.   
>
> We perhaps need to encourage use of a blog or a better use of the nascent Facebook page which has not yet been developed effectively to supplement the website content.
The demographic for potential site users is potentially very wide anyone aged between 10 and 100 with no restrictions imposed by age, gender, ethnicity, disability etc.  The more we can move the demographic away from the current preponderance of aging Anglo-Saxon white males the better - although we of course want to encourage them as well  and we have to accept the demographic reality of the overall Cumbrian population. We do not want to attract younger children unless and until we acquire new adult members who are prepared to put considerable effort into encouraging junior chess and providing a proper framework for doing that.

## Interviewee 3: Hana Cheney, end user

Hana does not play chess but has expressed interest in taking up the game in the past. Therefore, I interviewed her to understand what would be important to someone new to chess looking for a place to learn and play with others.

### Imagine you are looking for a chess club to join in your local area. What information would be most important to you to find on their website?

> Chess is an intimidating game to me so I would look for a welcoming, beginner and intermediate friendly environment. I’d like to know the leaders and other members of the club are welcoming and passionate about sharing this game with others. Of course after that I’d like to know their locations, building and office numbers, email and call info.  

### What other features or content would you find helpful?

> A page showing chess placements (squares on the board?? a-h and 1-8). Also tabs that show each piece and the parts they play in the game.  

### Would you find a section detailing the basic rules of chess helpful?

> ABSOLUTELY that would be so helpful. Every little detail would help people scared to pursue chess feel more at ease with basic questions being answered in a page or more. Like I mentioned in the above answer, a small tab that scrolls out when you hover over them to show game pieces, names, and other info, would be very helpful for people to look into it in their own time in the site so they don’t have to go to the club or outside of the website to get it. Anything that better prepares someone for the basic beginning parts of chess before they head in so they can look at the info in their own time.  

### Would you take the visual design of the site into consideration? Barring any other factors, would you be more inclined to join a group with a more modern or stylishly designed site?

> I would definitely take the website design into consideration. Something with a softer design that borders modern would be more inviting to me as a beginner. Something stylish would be nice, but it runs the possibility of being loud if that makes sense??? If there is a balance, that would be great.  

## Interviewee 4: Tim Lounds, end user

Tim is an active member of the Kendal Chess Club, attending weekly as well as representing the club in county tournaments. I interviewed him to get an idea of what a member would expect from a club they are a part of, and what features would be important in that context.

> [answer]

### What features, content, or information do/would you find helpful as a member?

> [answer]

### Would you rather keep up with general chess world news through your club's site or other more established sources?
