# Kendal Chess Club

# Site Overview

The chess community in Cumbria and the South Lakes is thriving, but poorly designed and rarely updated websites may not reflect this to the uninitiated.  
Especially given the massive uptick in interest in and popularity of chess since the pandemic and the release of The Queen's Gambit on Netflix, local clubs need to be keeping up with current UX and web design principles to attract members, especially of a younger generation.  
This site aims to introduce prospective members to the Kendal Chess Club, offering information about meetings, venues, and contact details, as well as providing relevant information to current members, such as news and events.

## Strategy Plane

### Stakeholder Interviews  

In order to inform my decisions in the planning stages of this project, I conducted interviews with a number of potential stakeholders and users. These can be found in INTERVIEWS.md

### Target Audiences

The first stage in planning this project was to identify the stakeholders - those being, the site owner and end users of the site. End users can further be split up into three categories: 
- Users who do not play chess but are interested in starting;
- Users who do play chess and are looking for a club to play with (either after moving to a new location or having played solely online and wanting to experience "over-the-board" chess for the first time);
- Users who are an active member of the club.  

The demographic of these users is extremely broad - anyone from 12-70+ can (and does) attend the club, and members are a mix of men and women. Therefore, the site has to have wide appeal.  

### User Stories

- As someone new to chess, I want to learn the basic rules of the game. 
- As a prospective member, I want to find out when and where the club meets.
- As a prospective member, I want to contact the club organisers.
- As a parent of a young prospective member, I want to know the club's child safety guidelines and policies.
- As a current member, I want to be updated on any club news.
- As a current member, I want to see the status of any ongoing events or competitions.
- As a user, I want to be able to find relevant information quickly and without hassle. 
- As a user, I want to learn about the history of the club.   

### Site Aims

- To provide information on the club and its meetings.
- To allow users to keep up with club news and events.
- To allow users to contact club organisers quickly and easily.
- To showcase the club's history and unique offerings.
