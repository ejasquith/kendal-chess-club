# Stakeholder Interviews

During the planning stage of the project, I thought it would be wise to get some insight from real people who would be a potential part of the site's audience, rather than projecting my own ideas of what users may require from the site. The results of these are detailed below (all answers shown as written).

## Interviewee 1: Jonathan Rashleigh, client

Jonathan Rashleigh is the owner of the club's current site and team captain for the club. I interviewed him to get some insight into his visions, ideas, and goals for the site.  

### As the site owner, what value do you hope to gain from the site? What problems or opportunities do you want it to address?

### What features and content do you think the site should include to include to address those?

### What do you expect the primary demographic of site users to be?

## Interviewee 2: Fleoren, end user

## Interviewee 3: Hana Cheney, end user

Hana does not play chess but has expressed interest in taking up the game in the past. Therefore, I interviewed her to understand what would be important to someone new to chess looking for a place to learn and play with others.

### Imagine you are looking for a chess club to join in your local area. What information would be most important to you to find on their website?

> Chess is an intimidating game to me so I would look for a welcoming, beginner and intermediate friendly environment. I’d like to know the leaders and other members of the club are welcoming and passionate about sharing this game with others. Of course after that I’d like to know their locations, building and office numbers, email and call info.  

### What other features or content would you find helpful?

> A page showing chess placements (squares on the board?? a-h and 1-8). Also tabs that show each piece and the parts they play in the game.  

### Would you find a section detailing the basic rules of chess helpful?

> ABSOLUTELY that would be so helpful. Every little detail would help people scared to pursue chess feel more at ease with basic questions being answered in a page or more. Like I mentioned in the above answer, a small tab that scrolls out when you hover over them to show game pieces, names, and other info, would be very helpful for people to look into it in their own time in the site so they don’t have to go to the club or outside of the website to get it. Anything that better prepares someone for the basic beginning parts of chess before they head in so they can look at the info in their own time.  

### Would you take the visual design of the site into consideration? Barring any other factors, would you be more inclined to join a group with a more modern or stylishly designed site?

> I would definitely take the website design into consideration. Something with a softer design that borders modern would be more inviting to me as a beginner. Something stylish would be nice, but it runs the possibility of being loud if that makes sense??? If there is a balance, that would be great.  

## Interviewee 4: Tim Lounds, end user

Tim is an active member of the Kendal Chess Club, attending weekly as well as representing the club in county tournaments. I interviewed him to get an idea of what a member would expect from a club they are a part of, and what features would be important in that context.
